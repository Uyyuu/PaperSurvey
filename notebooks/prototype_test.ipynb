      "improvements in efficiency and robustness (§6). Existing large language models (llms) are trained almost\n",
      "entirely end-to-end, except for tokenization—a heuristic pre-processing step that groups bytes into a static set\n",
      "of tokens. Such tokens bias how a string is compressed, leading to shortcomings such as domain/modality\n",
      "sensitivity (Dagan et al., 2024), sensitivity to input noise (§6), a lack of orthographic knowledge (Edman\n",

      "Tokenization has previously been essential because directly training llms on bytes is prohibitively costly\n",

      "and it is possible for the optimal architectural choices to change as we scale to 8B parameters and beyond,\n",
      "which may unlock improved performance for larger scales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing transformer libraries and codebases are designed to be highly efficient for tokenizer-based transformer\n",
      "architectures. While we present theoretical flop matched experiments and also use certain efficient implementations (such as FlexAttention) to handle layers that deviate from the vanilla transformer architecture,\n",

      "\n",

      "### 10 Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper presents the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new architecture that redefines the conventional\n",
      "dependency on fixed-vocabulary tokenization in large language models. By introducing a dynamic, learnable\n",
      "method for grouping bytes into patches, BLT effectively allocates computational resources based on data\n",
      "complexity, leading to significant improvements in both efficiency and robustness. Our extensive scaling study\n",
      "demonstrates that BLT models can match the performance of tokenization-based models like Llama 3 at\n",
      "scales up to 8B and 4T bytes, and can trade minor losses in evaluation metrics for up to 50% reductions in\n",
      "inference flops. Furthermore, BLT unlocks a new dimension for scaling, allowing simultaneous increases in\n",
      "model and patch size within a fixed inference budget. This new paradigm becomes advantageous for compute\n",
      "regimes commonly encountered in practical settings. While directly engaging with raw byte data, BLT also\n",
      "improves the model’s ability to handle the long-tail of data, offering significant improvements in robustness to\n",
      "noisy inputs and a deeper understanding of sub-word structures. Overall, these results position BLT as a\n",
      "promising alternative to traditional tokenization-based approaches, providing a scalable and robust framework\n",
      "for more efficient and adaptable language models.\n",
